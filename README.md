# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

    This SVG Logo Maker is an easy way for developers to generate their own SVG logos using the Node.js JavaScript runtime-environment, and the Inquirer.js NPM package. Run the application, answer a series of simple questions, and generate your own SVG logo!

## Installation

    In order to install this application, you must first clone the following GitHub repository to your local machine: https://github.com/claxCode/logo-maker . Once the necessary files have been imported, navigate to the appropriate directory containing the 'index.js' file and run 'npm i' in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies. This application includes the Node.js, Inquirer.js, and Jest NPM packages, as can be referenced in the package.json file within the 'dependencies' object. It is worth noting that while the Jest NPM is intended to be used for testing within this application, there is no need for the end user to install it on their machine as it is not necessary to enable the functionality of the program.

## Usage

    In order to use this application, simply invoke the series of command line prompts by running 'node index.js' in the terminal after navigating to the directory containing the 'index.js' file. The user will then be presented with a series of questions in the command line, and their input will be used to generate an individually tailored 'logo.svg' file. When answering these questions, the user will be able to determine the shape of their logo, the color of that shape, the text content (up to three letters, so great for initials or an acronym!), and the color of their text. Once all of the questions have been answered, the 'logo.svg' file will be rendered and created within the root directory containing the index.js file.

## Features

    The core of this application is the Node.js JavaScript runtime-environment, which enables the user to witness the execution of JavaScript code outside of a browser's web API. We're enabling the File System module contained within Node.js to allow us to use our data to generate the 'logo.SVG' file, and Inquirer.js allows us to determine these critical data points through a series of user-answered command line prompts.
